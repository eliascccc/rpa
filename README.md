# Robot Runtime

A python runtime for small scale RPA

---

## Overview

'Runtime' is this text refers to the input layer, local orchestration and decision logic part of an RPA deployment. (this project is just the Runtime part), You also need an rpa tool (power automate, uipath studio)
to do the UI autmations. The Runtime and the RPA tool together forms 'the robot'.
This project is useful for getting started with automating tasks in a business unit. it runs on a single machine with one single file.
this principle is: screenclicks -> done by the RPA tool. The rest (job intake, orchestration and logic) -> this python project

## Job source examples

The runtime supports two types of job sources: emails and queries.

#### Email-driven
A user sends an email → Python validates and prepares the job → writes to `handover.json` → RPA executes UI actions → Python verifies and responds.

#### Query-driven
Python polls a data source → detects a valid case → prepares payload → signals RPA → RPA executes → Python verifies the outcome.


---

## Key Idea
This project separates responsibilities between the Orchestrator and the RPA tool:

* The **Runtime (this project)** handles:
  - how jobs enter the system (e.g. via email)
  - how jobs are discovered autonomously (e.g. queries)
  - access control and validation
  - job state tracking and audit logging
  - preparing payloads and handover to an RPA tool
  - verifying results after execution
  - handling failures

* The **RPA tool** handles:
  - UI automation (clicks, keyboard input, ERP/UI interaction)

They communicate through a file-based IPC mechanism (`handover.json`).

## Architecture

The diagram shows:

* How the Runtime and the RPA tool run independently
* How your RPA tool must be implemented

---

## Features

* Email-driven job processing (personal inbox)
* Shared inbox support (partially implemented)
* Query-driven jobs (ERP/data polling)
* SQLite audit-style logging (`job_audit.db`)
* Crash-safe mode (`safestop`)
* Built-in screen recording (ffmpeg)
* Final user replies after verification (DONE / FAIL)
* Screen-recording link included in final reply
* Runs without administrator rights
* Cross-platform (Windows and Linux)
* Single-file runtime (`main.py`) for easy sharing and inspection

---



## Running the Project

### Requirements

* Python 3.14
* `openpyxl`
* `ffmpeg` (optional, for screen recording)

---

### Start

```bash
python main.py
```

---

### Test setup

Use included dev tools:

* `fake_jobs_generator.py`
* `rpa_tool_simulator.py`

---



## Intended Use Case

* Small internal automation (5–10 users)
* No dedicated RPA infrastructure
* No admin rights required
* Cheap “extra laptop” deployment
* Pilot / proof-of-concept automation








## What this project is not

You still need a real RPA tool to execute UI automation steps.

This includes tools such as:

* Microsoft Power Automate
* UiPath Studio
* Blue Prism
* [Robot Framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework)
* [TagUI](https://github.com/aisingapore/TagUI)
* [RPA for Python](https://github.com/tebelorg/RPA-Python)

These tools perform the actual UI interactions (clicks, keyboard input, screen automation).

## Why not just use X?

#### Why not just use RPA for everything?

You can — but it tends to lead to:

* Business logic spread across visual workflows
* Difficult testing and debugging
* Fragile automations that break on small UI changes

In this project the RPA tool is used for what it does best: UI interactions (clicks, keyboard input, screen automation).
This tools include Microsoft Power Automate, UiPath Studio, Blue Prism, [Robot Framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework), [TagUI](https://github.com/aisingapore/TagUI), [RPA for Python](https://github.com/tebelorg/RPA-Python)

---

#### Why not just use Python for everything?

Python is great for logic and data processing, but:

* It cannot reliably interact with arbitrary GUIs
* Many business systems (ERP, legacy apps) require UI automation

This project capitalize on the simplicity and large resources avaliable for Python ecosystem.

---

#### Why not use an enterprise orchestrator?

Enterprise orchestrators (e.g. UiPath Orchestrator, Control Room, [orchestrator_rpa](https://github.com/daferferso/orchestrator_rpa), [orchestrator_rpa](https://github.com/daferferso/orchestrator_rpa), [openorchestrator](https://github.com/itk-dev-rpa/OpenOrchestrator), robotframework() 

* Require infrastructure, setup, and licensing
* Are designed for large-scale, multi-bot environments

This project intentionally avoids that scope and runs on a single machine with simple file- and DB-based state.
If you need distributed execution, queues, or centralized control — this project is the wrong tool.

---

#### Why not use a workflow orchestrator? (delete this?)

Workflow tools (e.g. Airflow, Prefect) are built for:

* Scheduled and data pipelines
* Data engineering workflows
* Distributed task execution

This project is much smaller, local-first, and designed around business-triggered jobs (email, ERP signals) plus screen-based RPA

---
## Deployment require

- extra laptop
- a new inbox such as rpa@yourcompany.com
- an RPA tool
- runtime setup (mail & ERP backend, do jobhandlers, select screen-recording destination folder, set operating hours and network health check path)

---

## License

MIT (recommended)

---

## Status

Early-stage / experimental, but functional.
